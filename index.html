<p style="position: relative; bottom: 200px;">
   The first person to apply for a patent for a telescope was Dutch eyeglass maker  Hans Lippershey (or Lipperhey). In 1608, Lippershey laid claim to a device that could magnify objects three times. His telescope had a concave eyepiece aligned with a convex objective lens.

   <p class="textGalileo">
   In 1609, Galileo Galilei heard about the "Dutch perspective glasses" and within days had designed one of his own — without ever seeing one. He made some improvements — his could magnify objects 20 times — and presented his device to the Venetian Senate.Galileo was the first to point a telescope skyward. He was able to make out mountains and craters on the moon, as well as a ribbon of diffuse light arching across the sky — the Milky Way. He also discovered the rings of Saturn, sunspots and four of Jupiter's moons.

  <h2>Most famous telescopes</h2>

   <p class="hubble"><b>Hubble Space telescope:</b> </p>
    <p class="hubble">
        The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a 2.4 m-diameter space telescope optimised to observe from the ultraviolet to the infrared, collaborated between ESA and NASA. Launched in 1990 and designed for refurbishment by astronauts, Hubble is one of the greatest scientific projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="hubble">Tasks of the telescope:
    </p>
<img src="images/Hubble telescope.jpg" alt="Hubble space telescope" id="Hubble">
    <ul class="texthubble">
        <li>Determing the age of the universe</li>
        <li>Finding more moons near Pluto</li>
        <li>Doing observation of galaxies in the young universe</li>
        <li>Monitoring space weather on the outer planets</li>
        <li>Observing exoplanets</li>
    </ul>
<p style="position: relative; bottom: 300px;"> <b>James Weeb telescope:</b> </p>
<img src="images/James Webb telescope.jpg" alt="James Webb telescope" id="jameswebb">
<p class="textjameswebb">This is the successor to Hubble.Unlike Hubble, this telescope will be parked far from Earth and out of reach of repair crews. Its science will look at four major themes: the universe's first light, how the first galaxies were formed, how stars are formed, and looking at the origins of life (including exoplanets).
</p>

<p style="position: relative; bottom: 400px;"> <b>Kepler telescope:</b> </p>
<p class="textkepler">This planet-hunting machine has found more than 4,000 potential planets since first launching in 2009. Initially, it focused on a section of the Cygnus constellation, but in 2013 problems with pointing consistently created a new mission in which Kepler moves between different regions of the sky. One of Kepler's major contributions is finding more super-Earths and rocky planets, which are harder to spot near bright stars.</p>

<p style="position: relative; bottom: 300px;"> <b>Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA):</b> </p>
<p class="textatacama">This telescope in Chile has 66 receivers and its specialty is looking through the dust in young planetary systems (or through dusty stars and galaxies) to see how cosmic objects are formed. It was fully operational as of 2013. ALMA is unique in its sensitivity because it has so many receivers available. Some of its results include the clearest-ever image of the star Betelgeuse, and precise measurements of black hole masses.</p>

<p id="Types"><h1 style="position: relative; bottom: 40px;">Types of telescopes</h1></p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Refracting telescope <br>
    The refracting telescope is one of the simplest to use. There are two lenses in the refracting telescope. Light enters the end of the telesope, the lens refracts or bend the light, and the image is magnified for vieweing through the eyepiece.
    The refracting telescope can be quite large and heavy. They usually have a large aperture for allowing more light to enter through the primary lens.

        <li>Type: Apochromatic refractor</li>
        <li>Costs: &#126 $933</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <li style="position: relative; bottom: 200px;">Reflecting telescope <br>
    This type of telescope is known as a catoptrics version of a telescope. The tube and lens system is similar to that of a refracting telescope.
    There are many things similar, but others are vastly different for a reflecting telescope. The tube allows light to enter through one end. On that end is a primary mirror, and on the other end is a secondary mirror.
    The primary mirror reflects the light to the secondary mirror and towards the eyepiece. The eyepiece is normally mounted on the side of the tube, which is how you can see the difference immediately in a telescope.
    Reflecting telescopes are popular because they’re smaller and compact compared to refracting telescopes.

        <li>Type: Newtonian telescope</li>
        <li>Costs: &#126 $700</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <li style="position: relative; bottom: 450px;">Catadioptric telescope <br>
    The catadioptric is a hybrid option based on both reflecting and refracting telescopes. Its name is even a hybrid of the names of the refracting (dioptrics) and reflecting (catoptrics) type of telescope.
    The interior of the tube has a corrective lens that allows incoming light. The light is reflected from a primary mirror to a secondary mirror. It’s reflected back to the primary mirror and the eyepiece.
    It’s a great telescope for all kinds of purposes like focusing galaxies and planets for amateur astronomers of all experience – whether beginners or advanced users.

        <li>Type: Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope</li>
        <li>Costs: &#126 $3200</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <li style="position: relative; bottom: 720px;">Radio telescope <br>
    This type of telescope uses radio waves to create images of far-off celestial bodies. Every object in the sky gives of radio waves.
    Those waves are read by huge antennas that have large dishes attached. They’re normally not used by amateur astronomers, though. Those huge dishes you see with three spokes in the middle are radio telescopes.
    </li>

    <img src="images/imageradio.jpg" alt="" id="imageradio">

    <li style="position: relative; bottom: 650px;">X-Ray and Gamma-Ray telescope <br>
    Like radio telescopes, x-ray and gamma-ray telescopes use the rays that the bodies of the suns, supernovas, and stars give off to create their images.
    It’s how astronomers are able to see events that occur in deep space like supernovas and black holes.
    The gamma-ray telescope detects the burst of gamma rays that help confirm events taking place in space that can’t be detected with visual confirmation.
    X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes are used at higher elevations, so there’s no worry about pollution altering the images.
